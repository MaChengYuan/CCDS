**motivation** :

Detection for Ventricular tachycardia, Acute coronary syndrome, Mediastinitis, stroke 
Precaution before the symptom become serious

### Problem Statement : 

Many diseases could threat health, usually we would like to make precaution or notice the abnormality 
before health status becomes serious. Machine learning could be a ideal way to make prediction by 
finding patterns in features. 

### Result :

1. after feature extraciton, features were trimmed to around 200, and f1 score still could maintain with good quality
2. it is ovcious to see that "test" feature could influence the prediction more than other features
more details are shown in ***predictive modeling final report.pdf***

### Dataset :

Dataset is unavailable to be public for the protections of patient's privace, datasets contains medical test, 
already diagnosed diseases and basic data of each patients
